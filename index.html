	<p> Erica Rodriguez is a teacher, video producer and a full-stack web developer in training at the University of Texas School of Professional Education. She's a native Houstonian and third-generation Texan. When she's not trying to Google her way out of a coding conundrum she's filming crafting videos for a popular kids YouTube channel. Through the magic of the Internet, she teaches English part-time in the wee hours of the morning to children living in China. She has a master's degree in teaching from Relay Graduate School of Education and a bachelor's degree of print journalism from Texas State University. A former middle-school teacher, Erica hopes to use her coding skills to build educational sites for children. She has a special love-hate relationship with the sport of CrossFit and can often be found shuffling around local gyms working out or producing fitness videos. She lives in Houston with her cat, Tia.
